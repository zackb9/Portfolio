# Portfolio
Portfolio of some of my most enjoyable projects from this last year at UC Berkeley studying for a Master's in Statistics. This includes: 

* My Master's Capstone project - sales prediction models for bakeries in France using LSTM NNs, time series and regression analysis
* A NLP project where we predict the success of crowdfunding campaigns using a combination of text and numerical data
* An analysis of the Ames Housing dataset using Lasso, ridge and principal component regression, as well as comparison with XGBoost
* Sports modelling projects using poisson regression, Monte Carlo simulation and neural networks
* The thesis from my undergraduate degree in Mathematics.
